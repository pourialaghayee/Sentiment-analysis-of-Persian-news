# Sentiment-analysis-of-Persian-news
In this project, we created a model for classifying impact news from non-impact news based on a database made by us in the Persian language. We applied two different structures to extract the most effective model. One of the methods we considered was to apply the Parsbert pre-trained transformer and finetune it on our own news. An alternative method was to use a bidirectional LSTM model. Finally, we concluded that using the Transformer model yielded a better output. Our next idea for future work is to combine these models to get the highest possible result.
